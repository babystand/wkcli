# Wani Kani CLI

## WaniKani reviews from the comfort of the terminal!

Pros:

- Provides kana input for Japanese reading review items without the need for an IME
- Displays additional information and mnemonics to submitted answers
- More condensed/streamlined than the web experience
- Makes it look like you're hard at work doing hacker things

Cons:

- Some characters (esp. radicals) may have rendering issues depending on terminal font
- Does not (yet) provide a view for the results page at the end of a review
- Does not (yet) work for lessons
- If you somehow get navigated outside of the login, dashboard, or review pages the program will HACF
